# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Tab completion no longer times out inside function call arguments (e.g. `str(aaa_` + Tab). R's completer takes significantly longer when inside a function call because it also looks up argument names. The fix raises the completion timeout floor to 1000ms in that context (and for `::` completions), giving sufficient headroom while retaining a safety boundary against hung completions (#204)

## [0.3.4] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- **Experimental:** `;` shortcut to switch to shell mode at an empty R prompt (`experimental.shell_semicolon_shortcut`). One keypress — no `:shell` or Enter required. Similar to Julia REPL shell mode. When the buffer is not empty, `;` inserts a semicolon as usual. Disabled by default. (#192)

### Fixed

- `:help` no longer fails to render documentation for functions whose Rd source contains `%` operators (e.g. `base::solve`). The root cause was passing `as.character(rd)` without `deparse = TRUE`, which left `%` unescaped and caused the Rd parser to treat the rest of the line as a comment, losing closing braces and producing a parse error (#198)
- History menu replacement now works correctly inside auto-matched pairs (e.g. `(`, `[`, `"`): selecting a history entry no longer leaves the closing delimiter behind (#200)

## [0.3.3] - 2026-05-10

### Added

- `arf -f -`: read R script from stdin when `-` is passed as the file argument
- `arf ipc eval` and `arf ipc send`: `code` argument is now optional; when omitted, code is read from stdin (exits with an error if stdin is a TTY)

### Fixed

- (Windows) `crossterm` patch updates for VT input handling in interactive terminals (#175, #181)
  - Clear `ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_INPUT` (`VT_INPUT`) on exit to restore key handling in shells such as nushell running in Windows Terminal
  - Bump patched `crossterm` revision to include a VT input batch-boundary parsing fix

## [0.3.2] - 2026-05-03

### Added

- Shell mode now supports path completion (#170)

### Fixed

- (Windows) Set `.Platform$GUI` to `"arf-console"` to avoid Rgui-only code paths that can break behavior under arf (#169)
- **Experimental:** Ensure `ARF_IPC_SESSIONS_DIR` override is consistently honored in headless/IPC paths across platforms (#173)

## [0.3.1] - 2026-04-26

### Added

- Document Scoop installation method in README for Windows users (#161)

### Fixed

- (Windows) `.First()` and `.First.sys()` are now called after `.Rprofile` is sourced, matching R's standard startup sequence. Previously these hooks were skipped, causing vscode-R session watcher connections to fail and user-defined startup logic in `.First()` to be ignored (#159)
- (Windows) Restore the parent shell's original console input mode when `arf` exits, preventing shells such as nushell in Windows Terminal from losing `Backspace` and `Enter` after quitting (#162)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-16

### Removed

- **Breaking:** Positional script argument (`arf file.R`) has been removed. Use `-f`/`--file` instead: `arf -f file.R` (#151)

### Fixed

- **Experimental:** Place IPC Unix socket in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/arf/` instead of `~/.cache/arf/sessions/`, which is the correct XDG location for runtime sockets. Falls back to a randomized temporary directory when `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is not set (e.g. macOS). The socket directory is now validated for safe ownership and permissions (#145)
- Nested list autocomplete (e.g. `l$a$`) no longer returns "NO RECORDS FOUND" — structural operators (`$`, `@`, `[`, `:`) now correctly trigger a fresh completion fetch instead of filtering the previous cache (#150)

## [0.2.7] - 2026-04-02

### Fixed

- Handle Ctrl+C during R evaluation instead of crashing (#143)

## [0.2.6] - 2026-03-29

### Added

- **Experimental:** Headless mode (`arf headless`) for running R without the interactive REPL, controlled entirely via JSON-RPC IPC. Designed for AI agents and CI environments where a terminal is not available (#119, #122, #123, #124, #125, #126)
  - `--bind`, `--pid-file`, `--quiet`, `--log-file` options and graceful shutdown on SIGTERM/SIGHUP
  - `--json` flag to output session info as JSON on startup, enabling programmatic discovery of socket path and session details (#130)
  - Persists evaluated commands to history database with session-scoped isolation via unique session IDs (#133, #134)
- **Experimental:** IPC `history` method and `arf ipc history` CLI subcommand for querying R command history from external tools (#136)
- **Experimental:** IPC session info (`arf ipc session`, `arf ipc list`) and session file now include `log_file` field, exposing the headless mode log file path for debugging and monitoring

### Changed

- **Experimental/Breaking:** All `arf ipc` subcommands now output JSON to stdout (pretty-printed on terminal, compact when piped) (#137)
  - Commands that previously used plain text (`list`, `eval`, `send`, `shutdown`) now return structured JSON
  - Errors are written to stderr as JSON objects of the form `{"error": {"code": "...", "message": "...", "hint": ..., "data": ...}}` with all fields always present (null when not applicable) for a fixed schema
  - Exit codes now indicate error category: 2 (transport), 3 (session), 4 (protocol)
- **Experimental/Breaking:** `arf ipc eval` no longer exits with code 1 for R evaluation errors. R errors are returned as part of the JSON response (exit 0) to distinguish from IPC failures. The `value` and `error` fields are always present (null when not applicable)

### Removed

- **Experimental/Breaking:** Remove the `arf ipc status` subcommand, which is superseded by `arf ipc session` (returns a superset of the same information via IPC)
- **Experimental:** Remove `send` as a JSON-RPC method alias for `user_input`. The CLI subcommand `arf ipc send` is unchanged

## [0.2.5] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- **Experimental:** JSON-RPC IPC server for external tool integration (`--with-ipc`). Supports `evaluate` (silent/visible), `user_input`, and `send` methods over Unix domain sockets (Linux/macOS) or named pipes (Windows). Includes mutual exclusion with console input, alternate mode rejection, and session file discovery. (#113)
- **Experimental:** `:ipc` meta command to start/stop/check IPC server status at runtime (#113)
- Accept all R-compatible CLI flags (`--slave`, `--no-echo`, `--no-save`, `--no-restore`, etc.) so arf can be used as a drop-in `R` replacement in scripts (#109, #111)

### Fixed

- **Windows:** Switch `CharacterMode` from `RGui` to `LinkDLL` to prevent `system()` calls from hanging (#117)

## [0.2.4] - 2026-03-03

### Added

- Matching bracket highlighting: when cursor is on or after a bracket (`()`, `[]`, `{}`), both brackets are highlighted with a background color. Syntax-aware via tree-sitter (skips brackets in strings/comments). Configurable via `[editor] highlight_matching_bracket` (default: `false`) and `[colors.r] matching_bracket` (default: `"LightYellow"`) (#106)
- R's `options(width)` is now synced with the terminal width at startup and dynamically on resize, configurable via `[r] auto_width` (default: `true`) (#104)
- `:changelog` meta command to view the arf changelog in the built-in Markdown pager
- `ARF_HISTORY_DIR` environment variable to override the history directory (priority: CLI `--history-dir` > `ARF_HISTORY_DIR` > TOML `[history] dir` > XDG default)
- Experimental fuzzy matching for `pkg::func` namespace patterns and `library()`/`require()` package name completions (`experimental.r_completion.fuzzy`)
- Configurable `package_functions` for custom function names that trigger package completion (e.g., `box::use`)
- `:restart!` and `:switch!` commands to skip confirmation prompt

### Changed

- Config file parse errors are now reported on startup instead of silently falling back to defaults. `:info` shows the error type, and `arf config check` subcommand provides detailed validation with line/column info (#91)

## [0.2.3] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- Help pages are now rendered as styled Markdown with syntax-highlighted R code blocks (#83)
- Help browser: vignettes and demos listed in search results can now be opened when selected (#80)

### Fixed

- **Windows:** Fixed child process not being waited on during restart, which could cause orphaned processes (#84)
- `R_LIBS_SITE` is no longer incorrectly overridden, fixing site-library discovery on Scoop-installed R (Windows) (#86)

## [0.2.2] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed

- **Unix:** Password prompt (askpass) no longer echoes plaintext input (#78)
- Duration display is now properly cleared after meta command execution (#75)

## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-07

### Added

- `:cd`, `:pushd`, `:popd` meta commands for directory navigation (#60)
  - Path autocompletion with fuzzy matching for `:cd` and `:pushd` arguments
  - In shell mode and `:system`, `cd`/`pushd`/`popd` show a hint suggesting the meta command alternative
- Experimental `{duration}` prompt placeholder for showing command execution time (#75)
  - Format follows starship convention: "5s", "1m30s", "2h48m30s"
  - Configurable format via `experimental.prompt_duration.format` (default: `"{value} "`)
  - Configurable threshold via `experimental.prompt_duration.threshold_ms` (default: 2000ms)
  - Color via `colors.prompt.duration` (default: Yellow)

### Fixed

- Windows: `~` now correctly resolves to the Documents folder instead of USERPROFILE, fixing `R_LIBS_USER` paths when the Documents folder has been moved to a different drive (#68)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-06

### Added

- Experimental history browser for interactive history management with search, filtering, copy, and delete support (#38)
  - Column headers, exit code column, and working directory column (#47)
  - Minimum terminal size warning for pager browsers (#50)
- Experimental `arf history import` subcommand for importing history from radian, R, or another arf database (#31)
- Experimental `arf history export` subcommand for backing up history to a unified SQLite file (#54)
  - Exports both R and shell history to a single file with customizable table names
  - Use with `arf history import --from arf` to restore or transfer history
- `editor.auto_suggestions` now supports `"cwd"` mode for directory-aware suggestions (#55)
  - When set to `"cwd"`, suggestions are filtered to history entries recorded in the current directory
  - Falls back to all history if no matches found
- Enhanced `:info` meta command with pager view, clipboard copy, and path masking (#29)
- Vi mode indicator support for prompts via `prompt.vi` and `colors.prompt.vi` config (#23)

### Changed

- `arf history import` now skips duplicate entries by default (anti-join on command text and timestamp). Use `--import-duplicates` to import all entries regardless (#52)
- `arf history import --from arf` now supports importing from unified export files (files other than `r.db` or `shell.db`)
  - Use `--r-table` and `--shell-table` to specify custom table names
- History browser now displays timestamps in local time instead of UTC (#53)
- Vi mode prompt indicators now have sensible defaults: `[I]` for insert mode (LightGreen) and `[N]` for normal mode (LightYellow) (#45)
- **BREAKING:** Configuration structure reorganized — the `[reprex]` section has been split into `[startup.mode]` and `[mode.reprex]` for better semantic organization (#27)
- **BREAKING:** `editor.autosuggestion` config key renamed to `editor.auto_suggestions` for naming consistency with `auto_match` (#48)
- **BREAKING:** `completion.function_paren_check_limit` config key renamed to `completion.auto_paren_limit` (#48)
- **BREAKING:** `editor.mode` is now a typed enum accepting only `"emacs"` or `"vi"` (#48)
- Improved JSON Schema for color properties with proper `oneOf` typing (named string, `{ Fixed: N }`, `{ Rgb: [r, g, b] }`) (#48)

#### Migration Guide

If you have a custom configuration file from 0.1.x, apply the following changes:

| 0.1.x key | 0.2.0 key |
|-----------|-----------|
| `reprex.enabled` | `startup.mode.reprex` |
| `reprex.autoformat` | `startup.mode.autoformat` |
| `reprex.comment` | `mode.reprex.comment` |
| `editor.autosuggestion` | `editor.auto_suggestions` |
| `completion.function_paren_check_limit` | `completion.auto_paren_limit` |
| `editor.mode = "vim"` | `editor.mode = "vi"` |

**Before (0.1.x):**

```toml
[reprex]
enabled = false
comment = "#> "
autoformat = false

[editor]
autosuggestion = true

[completion]
function_paren_check_limit = 50
```

**After (0.2.0):**

```toml
# Initial mode settings (can be toggled at runtime via :reprex, :autoformat)
[startup.mode]
reprex = false
autoformat = false

# Static reprex configuration (not changeable at runtime)
[mode.reprex]
comment = "#> "

[editor]
auto_suggestions = true

[completion]
auto_paren_limit = 50
```

### Fixed

- **Windows:** Enable bracketed paste mode by patching crossterm with VT input + ANSI parser hybrid support ([crossterm#1030](https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm/pull/1030))
- **Windows:** Fixed garbled error message display caused by CRLF line endings in R output (#56)
- **Windows:** Fixed multiline input causing "invalid token" error due to CRLF newlines from reedline (#57)
- Set `R_DOC_DIR`, `R_SHARE_DIR`, and `R_INCLUDE_DIR` from R's shell wrapper script on startup. On distributions where these paths differ from the default `$R_HOME/<component>` (e.g. Fedora, RHEL), `:help` and `utils::hsearch_db()` could fail because `R.home("doc")` returned a non-existent path (#59)
- Flush stdout after print in `r_write_console_ex` to prevent output buffering issues (#44)
- Use display-width-aware truncation for "Copied" feedback message (#41)
- Mouse wheel scroll now moves cursor in history browser (#40)
- Use display-width-aware text utilities for correct CJK character rendering (#39)
- Correct sponge delay semantics in `history_forget` (#37)
- Windows: Manually source `.Rprofile` etc. after R initialization (#20)
- Use intermediate pointer cast for signal handlers (#16)
